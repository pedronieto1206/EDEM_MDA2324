I am a Materials and Mechanical Engineer with a PhD in Advanced Manufacturing. But what I like to do out of my professional life is sport, such as:
1.  Running, either on the road or trails. I prefer *trails*
2.  Likewise, I love riding my bike, but not mountain bike, because:
    1.  *I'm ok crushing myself against the rocks running, I don't need crashing at highers speeds*
    2.  I don't have more space at home for **another bike...**
3. Hiking is also a good option! Just make sure you bring proper footwear :D
